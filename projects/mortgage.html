<p>Mortgage risk analysis is the process used to determine how likely a borrower will default on a loan. This process is carried out by an underwriter who looks for specific areas of a borrower’s background for red flags including credit, capacity, cash flow, collateral, and character. While I am not an underwriter or an expert in credit risk, I am going to go through the process of identifying by developing a model on a borrower’s loan metadata and transactions throughout the life of the loan. The partition of data I’m working with contains details of roughly 5 million mortgages purchased between 2000 and 2001 and is available through Fannie Mae’s Single Family Loan Performance dataset. ## Exploring the Data The dataset contains a total of 28 unique lenders representing brokers, retail lenders and direct lenders offering Fixed Rate Mortgage loans to borrowers. 76% of loans originated through a retail lender or broker with an average value of $135K and a max of 500K.</p><img src="EDA_LENDERS_AVG.png" alt="EDA_LENDERS_AVG"> <p>Borrowers represent all territories of the US including Puerto Rico. While the majority of borrowers purchased loans for a primary residence, almost 10% is used for a secondary home or investment properties. The most popular location for a property is California, making up 13% of all properties purchased, which add up to $100B in total loans. </p><img src="EDA_TOTAL_LENT.png" alt="EDA_TOTAL_LENT">

<h2 id="risk-analysis">Risk Analysis</h2>

<p>For a loan to go into default status, it must be 90+ days delinquent in payment. To gather this data, I summarized the transactions of each account and flagged delinquent payments and the frequency of delinquency. I use these two values to make up a composite score called ‘risk score’ — which is the multiplicative relationship between the number of late payments and the maximum duration of delinquency. Finally, each account is grouped into one of three categories: Low (Q1), Medium (Q2-3) and High Risk (Q4). An example of a low-risk borrow may have been 20-30 days late on 1 or 2 payments throughout the life of their loan. A high-risk borrow may have been 60-90 days late on 10+ payments with their account being in delinquent status for several months. From 2000 to 2001, 3% of all loans purchased went into default. The total value of default loans ranges from 1%-6% of total sales — equating to 100s of millions of dollars. <img src="default_impact.png" alt=""> ## Results The most pertinent factors in determining a loan default are the number of borrowers and the loan to value ratio. Lenders allow borrowers to take on a loan with up to 10 borrowers. Isolating this data point shows that as each additional borrower is added, and thus responsible for payment, the probability of default declines.</p><img src="PDP_NUM_BORROWERS.png" alt="PDP_NUM_BORROWERS"> <p>Loan to Value (LTV) ratio — the ratio of the amount borrowed vs the value of the property. For example, if you took out a mortgage for $100K and your property is $300K, your LTV is 33%. Usually, sellers will give borrowers better rates on their loan if their LTV is below 80% because they have more equity in the property. Isolating this variable shows that borrowers with a high LTV (75% and above) have a higher probability of default.</p> 
<img src="PDP_LTV.png" alt="PDP_LTV"> 
<p>So if you’re planning to buy a mortgage on your own, you have a better chance of being approved if you have a substantial down payment (to lower your LTV) otherwise consider adding on co-borrowers.</p>
